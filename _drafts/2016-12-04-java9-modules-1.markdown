If *Java8* was about **Streams**, Java9 is definitely release about **modularity**. [Project Jigsaw][Jigsaw] is huge, long time project of OpenJDK. It [mailing list][Jigsaw-dev-mailing] started in 2009, when Java7 was in development. After many postpones it seems that we will get modularity in java version 9. Java9 itself had already few postpones and main reason is of course the **Jigsaw**. In time of writing this post, release is planned to July 2017.
